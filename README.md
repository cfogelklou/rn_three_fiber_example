# rn_three_fiber_example
An example project integrating react-three-fiber in a bare react-native app.

This app does not work correctly, yet

It is published now in order to contribute to getting react-three-fiber working in a bare react-native app.

What it does do is build for both ios and Android. However, the "Canvas" from react-three-fiber displays nothing.
